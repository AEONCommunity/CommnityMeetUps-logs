For anyone Interested Here's the agenda for the meeting, feel free to checkout the topics here: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/393585b0
Let's start off with a quick recap of the past 2 months since our last meeting
We invite everyone to visit the Aeon community GitHub repo that was setup. https://github.com/AEONCommunity
This repo was created for community members to have a central source for everything Aeon outside the main codebase. Also check out our webpage https://aeoncommunity.github.io/

Props to @thriftyMinnow for his work on a general Aeon Whitepaper https://github.com/AEONCommunity/aeon-whitepaper
GitHub
AEONCommunity/aeon-whitepaper
This is a proposed AEON whitepaper, to be considered by the community. - AEONCommunity/aeon-whitepaper

Let's move on to the juicy stuff: Community Discussions
One topic brought up was our Community Fund on AFS. Not many people know about this, but it was set up as a fund where the community (or anyone) can donate to this and then decide how the funds are spent. https://aeonfunding.com/donate
There are 328 Aeon(s) in there right now, Are there any comments or suggestions on this fund and how we should spend funds currently?
AEON Funding System
AEON Funding System - Make proposals related to AEON and get paid in cryptocurrency (AEON)!
BMO-noire was going to come up with some ideas for what to use the funds on and make a post. Would love anyone else's thoughts or ideas on how this can best be spent.
BMO-noire03/01/2019
Good morning! I have to run to work, wish i could chat
420Coupe03/01/2019
Until decided what's best for the funds, they will continue growing as we encourage members to continue donating to maintain community activity and engagement.
BigSlim03/01/2019
Hi
I hope everyone is doing well

I threw my 2 cents at that thread. I don't agree about going ASIC-friendly, but I'm willing to stay with the community to see how it goes. My pool will probably be shut down, though, so South America won't help with decentralization anymore.
420Coupe03/01/2019
The Opposing view is to switch to CN-R until ASICs are made for it, then determine the best decision for the best ASIC-Friendly mobile algo
On the topic of ASIC OS Schematics - i reached out to David Vorick, CEO of Nebulous Labs / OBelisk

A continuation of our community meeting last night, it was proposed that $AEON switch to an asic friendly Proof of Work. Consensus was shown in the meeting for this change. Additional community thoughts on this change can be discussed on reddit here https://t.co/07SVc3ATEx

BigSlim03/01/2019
I am not sure Aeon should reach out to start asic production right now. As it stands off the bat, hobby miners could gpu/cpu mine until ASICS were introduced
420Coupe03/01/2019
To develop an open source schematic for SHA-3 ASIC without physical design would be in the $200k ballpark range and developed with physical design in the $800k ballpark range. These would be designs that would be able to be launched with algo to deploy a fair open market
BigSlim03/01/2019
Thanks for reaching out to nebulous labs on this and getting numbers.
420Coupe03/01/2019
Believe it's best to have a fair idea of launch and 'go to market' that we'd be up against.

<dEBRUYNE> <smooth> sha-3 is not at all asic resistant <= To clarify, I posted that it would be CPU/GPU minable as long as no ASICs were created. I never stated that it would be ASIC resistant
420Coupe03/01/2019
was a lack of punctuation that made the sentence read weird. missing a comma.
@dEBRUYNE
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<camthegeek> No asic's exist for it currently. it is nicehash-able.
<camthegeek> also performance for mining seems weaker on cpu + amd graphic cards
<camthegeek> stronger for nvidia. none of this is a plus or minus.. it's just the opposite of what we have now
<camthegeek> if majority of farms are AMD, they'll still be able to mine but not as effeciently as nvidia farms/rigs.
<camthegeek> however, the switch will give everyone the chance to mine quite a bit of aeon until asic's arrive, if that ever happens.
<camthegeek> essentially, we're taking a risk by swapping to something without asics.. and hoping for the best until asic's arrive.. the same situation that we're in now.
<shigutso> SHA3 mining is better with nvidia?

<stoffu> moneromooo: I don't get your argument about social contract. "History is not changed." what do you mean here? I'm not talking about changing the past history; I'm talking about what we do in the future.
<stoffu> You can't change history of PoW blockchain :)
<moneromooo> I mean that I don't think anyobody ever promised miners their hardware would work forever.
<stoffu> Even coin emission schedule can be changed. Even for Bitcoin, as long as all participants agree.
<moneromooo> The past changing, I would agree this is a violation. The future changing, no, except for some things like monetary emission etc.
<stoffu> You just can't change past due to cumulative diff of blockchain, no?
<moneromooo> You can change past of course. Change consensus rules from an earlier height, anyone has to pop blocks to be able to sync to that new chain
<stoffu> Ah, that's like throwing away the past. Not very interesting though.
<stoffu> And I'm not talking about something like that.
<stoffu> Proposing to change the consensus rule from a certain point in future.
<moneromooo> I did not say you were fwiw.
<stoffu> I guess I missed the context then.
<moneromooo> I was basically saying "PoW change is definitely low on the scale of how unfair it is to change, compare to other changes such as retroactive changes or money supply etc".
<stoffu> Any change is fair as long as everyone agrees.
<stoffu> If an agreement isn't reached, a coin simply splits.
<stoffu> There's no fair or unfair.
<stoffu> BTW I think any coin with fixed supply like Bitcoin or Wownero will see a great challenge when the block reward dwindles. I'm curious to see if they'll be able to change the coin supply.
<moneromooo> If everyone agrees, sure, but that's impossiuble in practice.
<stoffu> Not necessarily impossible.
<moneromooo> Consensus is all you can really get.
<moneromooo> Well, sure.
<stoffu> When it's absolutely necessary, people will have to reconsider.
<moneromooo> not interested in splitting hairs, stops talking
<shigutso> Is there any fair voting system that we can use to see what the community prefer? Like 4 options: don't change PoW / change to CnR / change to SHA3 / change to CnRv2
420Coupe03/01/2019
the thing about cnR for me i feel it throws out mobile friendly
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<shigutso> aeon is not mobile friendly now
<shigutso> mobile friendly nowadays is connecting to a remote node
420Coupe03/01/2019
then it's already available
moneroju-aeon
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<shigutso> maybe one day the most basic mobile phone will have 16GB RAM and 8 CPU cores, but until then, it's not mobile friendly
<shigutso> monerujo-aeon uses remote node, no?
BigSlim03/01/2019
Sha3 was developed with armv8 specific attributes to be friendly for this hardware over other hardware. Most all phones are armv8 today
Also there are similar instruction sets for raspi devices
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<shigutso> running a full node in a mobile phone kills the battery, I don't see the purpose for it, maybe in the future, but not now
BigSlim03/01/2019
This could help to keep daemon running smoothly on mobile devices
You don’t need to run a daemon 24/7
Maybe 15-30min to sync and make transactions
It won’t kill a battery in that time
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<shigutso> it will consume a lot of RAM and CPU until it finishes syncing, and if you don't open your wallet for a week, it will also consume lots of bandwidth
<dEBRUYNE> <aeond> <BigSlim> From my tallies tonight there are 6 members for asic friendly change now and 3 members for CN-r changes now <= Not sure if I can still vote, but I'd vote for SHA3
BigSlim03/01/2019
We didn’t have an “official” vote. I just tallied people’s voiced opinions
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<shigutso> so, there are 42 people in #aeon (IRC) and 5k reddit users (most of them absent, sure, but still 5k), maybe we could have more people voting if a official way was provided
BigSlim03/01/2019
My opinion is for people to voice their thoughts and say directly what they are for. It’s all public information so people can read what they see. Currently there are what seems 7 votes sha3 4 votes cnR
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<camthegeek> There's github which has an undefined amount of participants. Perhaps opening an issue there as well would be beneficial to the conversation regarding SHA-3? stoffu
<stoffu> Good point.
<camthegeek> if you're able to currently, link the discussions on bitcointalk as well. If not, I can when I get a few additional minutes to spare

Proposal to switch to SHA-3 proof of work · Issue #103 · aeonix/aeon
(Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Aeon/comments/aw2xhn/proposal_to_switch_to_sha3_proof_of_work/) I believe now is the right time for Aeon to become ASIC friendly by switching to SHA-3 PoW (...

<camthegeek> excellent, thanks
<stoffu> I've posted a link to bitcointalk already.
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<vp11> I disagree with changing to SHA3 immediately (as in, in the next fork). I think it's an unnecessary blow on current miners. It's completely doable to go to CnR and then to SHA3 in a predefined date.
<dEBRUYNE> Having a grace period of 6 months that allows GPU/CPU miners to get some more incoming seems like a decent period
<dEBRUYNE> It may also raise funds for them to invest in ASICs
<dEBRUYNE> On the other hand, they still may be able to mine for another 3/4 months after SHA3 goes live if we switch fast
<stoffu> CPU/GPU miners can switch to other coins though.
<durinsmine> ...
<durinsmine> We are here to mine aeon
<durinsmine> not xmr or other coins
<stoffu> Why? You fell in love somehow? Mining should be incentivized by economic drive, not by emotion.
<durinsmine> Okay then
<vp11> stoffu, I understand that you don't care (or don't know/understand) about the mining community that gathers around a specific coin, but it sounds unwise to simply shrug them off because they're not exclusively going for economic drive.
<vp11> even more when a compromise is very doable
<stoffu> But I'm saying that 'compromise' has many real drawbacks.
<stoffu> I just want Aeon to remain sane.
<vp11> I probably missed the many real drawbacks of doing something like dEBRUYNE just suggested above.
<stoffu> If you love Aeon in its current ASIC resistant state, you're contributing to Aeon's death, IMO.
<moneromooo> "Sane" means no need to verify anything because people wont' be arses and steal your coins. It means no ring signatures because people will respect your privacy. etc etc.
<stoffu> What
<moneromooo> We already add things to protect against various things.
<stoffu> I don't understand what you're trying to say.
<moneromooo> I mean most of the code we have in a cryptocurrency is defenses against attacks.
<vp11> I think "sane" in this case would be stop defending against something that we can't win (ASICs).
<stoffu> I couldn't read that from your above comment.
<moneromooo> So I'm just saying "sane" is a matter of perspective. You're sayung trying to defend against 50% attackers is insane, maybe in this case, but it's not obviouly insane to me :)
<stoffu> I'm not saying that.
<moneromooo> OK. That's how I read it. Nevermind then.
<stoffu> Being too afraid of someone getting >50% hashrate is insane, that's what I'm saying.
<stoffu> Being too afraid of someone getting >50% hashrate at any given point in time is insane, that's what I'm saying.
<stoffu> This state is dangerous, but I believe it will transition to decentralized state again.
<moneromooo> Well, if someone does, you've failed. We continue because we want to try agian, but in reality, our coin is toast.
<stoffu> I believe so by observing Bitcoin.
<stoffu> Bitcoin hasn't been 51% attacked even though there must have been quite some occasions where some minority party obtained >50% hashrate.
<stoffu> Temporary centralization doesn't immediately mean the death of the network.
<moneromooo> I'm not saying it does. I'm just saying getting there is a failure.
<stoffu> Getting all the way to there is failure, sure, but touching there for a bit isn't.
<moneromooo> What's the point of trying to have something secure if it's so easy to breach ?
<vp11> Because someone didn't attack Bitcoin doesn't mean someone won't attack Aeon once 51% is reached.
<stoffu> So in my view, SHA-3 is the sane strategy, and ASIS resistance is insane.
<moneromooo> Well, if you think you'll have a better thing later, yes, it's worth it I think.

BigSlim03/01/2019
At its current state, all cryptocurrency is a gamble
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<stoffu> Yes, absolutely
BigSlim03/01/2019
Adoption is not that tar level yet
Ignore tar...
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> But we're not here to make a gamble, we're here to make somehting that is the opposite of a gamble. And we're totallycrypto_ops_builder failing.
<moneromooo> s/crypto_ops_builder//
<monerobux> moneromooo meant to say: But we're not here to make a gamble, we're here to make somehting that is the opposite of a gamble. And we're totally failing.
<moneromooo> Weird paste.
BigSlim03/01/2019
Failing right now maybe
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<dEBRUYNE> One could argue we're gambling with the tweaks too
BigSlim03/01/2019
But we also are not making big changes to attempt to be the opposite
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<stoffu> What, I'm here to gamble on a better future, instead of pretending to be happy with the status quo of fiat.
<moneromooo> You're working on making it better, not gambling.
BigSlim03/01/2019
Sometimes people need to take risks.
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<stoffu> Well, no one knows which way is the best, so it's gamble.
<stoffu> PoW itself is a gamble.
<stoffu> PoW seems much better than Ripple or FED, so we try with that.
<moneromooo> I suppose if you expand the definition of gambling, then OK, fine.
<vp11> ^
BigSlim03/01/2019
Opinion*
Right now Aeon is taking no risks to stand out and the value And core interest shows that
But then again there are risks with every decision made.
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<dEBRUYNE> <moneromooo> You're working on making it better, not gambling. <= Not sure if this was directed to me, but we can't reliably measure whether it decreases the efficiency gap of ASICs. Also, when looking at history, one could argue little improvement has been made, as ASICs were live after a mere 3 months on Monero after the most recent tweak
<vp11> stoffu, what are the "many real drawbacks" of going to CnR first and then, let's suppose, SHA3? the current slower verification time?
<stoffu> Please read the reddit post.
<vp11> I did.
<vp11> There are 3 points
<vp11> one is current verification time
<stoffu> yes
<moneromooo> No, to stoffu.
<vp11> second is "no guarantee to change" (my suggestion says we would change)
<vp11> third point is help monero, ok.
<vp11> so please, help me understand the "many real drawbacks"
<stoffu> moneromooo: Sorry, what are you referring to?
<moneromooo> To: <@dEBRUYNE> <moneromooo> You're working on making it better, not gambling. <= Not sure if this was directed to me,
<stoffu> vp11: One big drawback is the fact that we need to keep changing PoW indefinitely, and increasingly more frequently with increased adoption.
<vp11> <vp11> I disagree with changing to SHA3 immediately (as in, in the next fork). I think it's an unnecessary blow on current miners. It's completely doable to go to CnR and then to SHA3 in a predefined date.
<vp11> CnR -> SHA3 predefined date != keep changing PoW indefinitely
<stoffu> Why is that better than switching to SHA3 now?
<stoffu> From the post: Won't there be someone claiming "I have an idea for a better ASIC resistant PoW, so let's try it and see"?
<vp11> <dEBRUYNE> Having a grace period of 6 months that allows GPU/CPU miners to get some more incoming seems like a decent period
<vp11> <dEBRUYNE> It may also raise funds for them to invest in ASICs
<stoffu> Setting a predefined date doesn't seem to matter.
<vp11> it's a reasonable compromise
<stoffu> CPU/GPU miners can mine some other coins.
<vp11> if the rough consensus is to change to CnR and then to SHA3 we could definitely kill the argument of "new idea to ASIC resistant!"
<stoffu> I'm very doubtful about that.
BigSlim03/01/2019
If you know you are going to switch to sha3 at a predetermined date, it makes no sense to do something for a pow change inbetween
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<dEBRUYNE> vp11: You left out my statement where I posited that AEOn would likely be CPU/GPU minable for a few more months if it would switch to SHA3 now
BigSlim03/01/2019
7 for 5 against sha3 now
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<stoffu> smooth also said he thinks it'd be a bad idea to precommit to SHA3 on a certain date.
<moneromooo> From the link above: "as the market matures, cheaper ASICs will appear in the market which common people can buy for home use" -- I really don't see that happening in the near or medium future.
<camthegeek> We're not forking immediately. We would fork a month or three ahead of time. That's plenty of time to promote AEON for new miners, let older miners become updated, etc.
<stoffu> I believe it's binary: we do it now, or we never do.
<vp11> dEBRUYNE, yes, but it's just a chance, wishful thinking. a grace period is something fixed so current miners can prepare, ROI and invest in ASICs, etc
BigSlim03/01/2019
Deb and moo still undecided or I haven’t tracked them
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<camthegeek> Wasting time by implementing cn-random only creates more work and headaches later on down the road if asic's overrun the network again.
<moneromooo> "smooth also said he thinks it'd be a bad idea to precommit to SHA3 on a certain date." <- I missed that, what was the argument ?
<dEBRUYNE> bigslim: I am for changing to SHA3
<camthegeek> I'd rather rip the band-aids off and go with SHA-3 and allow that wound to heal vs keep applying bandages to an open wound that seems to never heal.
<moneromooo> BigSlim: I don't do the code, so I'm not voting for aeon.
BigSlim03/01/2019
I like that approach terminology cam
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<vp11> moneromooo, if that was the pre-requisite to vote then we would have maybe 3-4 people voting :D
<moneromooo> Yes, but I don't want to piss off stoffu :D
<vp11> that's a vote by itself :)
BigSlim03/01/2019
Moo you involve yourself with the community along with deb so I would assume you would be a community member
Lol
We already had one person rage quit this week

This /\
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<camthegeek> oh the dev-love.
<moneromooo> Good to know. But I think we agree on a lot of other things, so I won't let that one drive a wedge.
<moneromooo> And, tbh, I do feel some kind of egotistical interest at seeing how aeon does, as a guiding light / sacrificial lamb for monero.
<moneromooo> (sorry)
<vp11> camthegeek, would you know how many miners are distributed on known pools in recent times?
<stoffu> moneromooo: I don't remember smooth's argument regarding the precommitment. I guess he meant that precommitting to something in the future is generally hard.
<dEBRUYNE> vp11: I wouldn't necessarily call it wishful thinking. It takes at least 2-3 months to get an ASIC out
<camthegeek> vp11, can check cryptunit for that information. Minus 1 from each pool over 1Mh/s for the asic manufacturer.
<camthegeek> I have only verified this asic is on my pool and hashvault
<camthegeek> I can check the others
<vp11> dEBRUYNE, good point. I thought I read someone posted there were SHA3 ASICs somewhere already, though? Maybe I misread.
<vp11> camthegeek, will check cryptunit. I just want to have an idea of how many miners are there, roughly.
<moneromooo> There is definitely a lot of SHA-3 hardware. Making those into mining ASICs does not sound too complicated.
BigSlim03/01/2019
There are keecak sha3 rigs available for rent in MRR
404Gh
4 miners
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<vp11> ~450 miners on the network currently. there were ~550 on beginning of February.
<camthegeek> assume ~100 miners chase profit at certain levels.
<vp11> maybe the mining community isn't big enough for considering a grace period and then a definite change?
<vp11> I see how Monero wouldn't do it because you have +30k miners and the impact would be bigger.
<vp11> in Monero the community sounds a lot more important than in Aeon, I suppose it's the size.
<vp11> stoffu> moneromooo: I don't remember smooth's argument regarding the precommitment. I guess he meant that precommitting to something in the future is generally hard. <= Monero precommits to forks every 6 months and it 'kinda' works :P
<stoffu> Agreed, but barely works
<stoffu> Also this precommitment is only about the schedule, not some actual changes of consensus rules.
<marmulak> Am I late
<moneromooo> Not for next meeting.
<vp11> I don't think Aeon should precommit to constant forks. I don't even think it should change PoW every 6 months. I actually am inclined to see how SHA3 would work on Aeon. I just think it's unwise to shove off the current miners, but I can see how this can be unimportant depending on the perspective.
<camthegeek> How is it shoving off miners?
<marmulak> OK so what I understand that if we go SHA3 then I can create a farm of rpi's to mine aeon
<dEBRUYNE> <aeond> <BigSlim> There are keecak sha3 rigs available for rent in MRR <= Any idea what kind of hashrate a normal GPU would get on an SHA3 algo?
<moneromooo> rpis are good at SHA3 (relatively to CNv2) ?
<vp11> camthegeek, I'm assuming that once you change to SHA3 it won't take long until existing hardware mines it. Sounds like it's already availble from what I'm reading.
<vp11> so that means the 450 miners will have to buy ASICs or find something else to do
<marmulak> I didn't even know there was an sha3
<moneromooo> SHA-3 is a minor variation of Keccak.
<camthegeek> vp11, if market conditions stay like they are for AEON and other SHA-3 coins continue on with their market conditions, ASIC manufacturers will have no reason to develop for something with such a low market.
<dEBRUYNE> moneromooo: Would a keccak miner be compatible with SHA3 if it's an ASIC?
<vp11> camthegeek, as I said, I'm assuming the hardware already exists.
<ksk> which would then give us a PoW different from moneros - what many cpu/gpu miners here seem to want
<camthegeek> CN has a huge market now compared to pre-July 2017. ASIC manufacturers have reason to try to dip into CN and cash out.
<marmulak> I suppose the "something else to do" alternative to mining Aeon is just to buy it
<moneromooo> Depends on the particular miner. The changes are on the "envelope" IIRC, so it seems likely to be compatible.
<camthegeek> I don't think it exists but I have found evidence of FPGA's with bitstreams made for SHA3
<marmulak> why not just do keecak if we want to welcome asic mining
thinkpol03/01/2019
i posted this last night but here again https://security.cse.iitk.ac.in/sites/default/files/title_page_2_0.pdf
someone laying out a sha3 fpga
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> SHA-3 means existing hardware (not made for mining) can be reused more easily I think.
<vp11> camthegeek, people posted a couple of links already, BigSlim said you could rent rigs somewhere?
<durinsmine> 13:58 < ksk> which would then give us a PoW different from moneros - what many cpu/gpu miners here seem to want
thinkpol03/01/2019
fpgas are much more community-accessible i think
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<durinsmine> An algorithm that does not have asics made fore it
<durinsmine> Even XMR algo with minor tweak is better than exact algo as xmr
<marmulak> would we be the only blockchain to use sha3
<marmulak> or are others already
<camthegeek> there are others.
<camthegeek> but none cryptonote based
<camthegeek> as far as I looked into it anyways.
Foxgod03/01/2019
any major coins?
or small ones that are unnoticed?
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<camthegeek> one with a coin value same as aeon
<camthegeek> but they were slightly modified to be 'asic resistant'
Foxgod03/01/2019
then sha3 might not be top priority for asics
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> BTW, IIRC keccak was not the SHA-3 candidate that was most hardware implemention friendly.
<moneromooo> It was kind of a "middle ground" pick
<marmulak> I suppose the rational is, asic mining is inevitible, so we're chosing a pow that will accommodate asic's in the future but still give our own user base a chance to shore up against it by building our own mining power? Like, buying our own asic's or fpga's etc. Some of your messages make it sound like GPU's or some CPU's will somehow be competitive
Foxgod03/01/2019
i agree its unevitable
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> Like, SHA3 wouldn't help me as a home miner, would it?
<vp11> if the ASIC-friendly PoW algorithm doesn't currently have hardware available, then GPU/CPU miners would be able to mine it, because it would take time for manufacturers to develop it.
<marmulak> right
<durinsmine> Sha3 to accomodate asics just slaps every miner in the face who has supported this coin up to now
<marmulak> yeah but
<marmulak> we've already felt the slap when ASIC's came onto cnl and then cnl/1
<durinsmine> "thanks for supporting out coin for years but now its time for asics, tough shit, find a new coin"
<marmulak> and we accept that it's not reasonable to change algos constantly
<vp11> If there's hardware available, then this time would be a lot smaller and the current miners wouldn't probably be able to mine for more than a couple weeks? I imagine one ASIC miner would completely destroy thousands of CPU miners.
<ksk> durinsmine: I think we got your argument, that if asics would arrive, that your classic mining equipment will get useless for mining aeon.
<durinsmine> ksk so where is the incentive for new miners to join the network? there isn't because they have to buy an over sized paper weight with no resale value
<marmulak> have you guys considered multi-algo like myriad and friends
<ksk> durinsmine: the incentive for miners is profit I think. If people like the move of aeon going for sha3, maybe it will rise in value. this then encourages people to invest some more? who knows.
<marmulak> a multi algo cryptonote coin might be a worthwhile project, even if it's not aeon
thinkpol03/01/2019
i don't think anyone is pro-asic exactly so much as anti-constant-change.
Foxgod03/01/2019
is it possible to detect asics and lower their reward, instead of banning them?
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> I don't think so
<durinsmine> I get that constant change is a pain in the ass
<ksk> foxgod: this would totally be against the concepts of blockchains as far as I understand things ;)
thinkpol03/01/2019
it's trying to not fight the free market i think
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> I imagine one would try to punish users with very high hash rates, but clever miners would present themselves as many users instead of one
Foxgod03/01/2019
too bad, i was hoping for a middle ground where we accept asics without hurting cpu/gpu miners
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<durinsmine> We still haven't even done v8 fork so the constant change is nto even a point
<durinsmine> We only need to fork when asics are obviously here. If we dont use the same algo as XMR then they have to make Asic specifically for Aeon
<moneromooo> A possible argument against "ASICs are inevitable":
<moneromooo> The argument for it is that it is economically viable to build ASICs, because even if they're not that much
<moneromooo> more efficient than GPUs, it's still above. Now, one argument that does not actually counter this, but makes
thinkpol03/01/2019
is the point here to be a hobby or a future-proof means of exchange? aeon is not young
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> it consequence less dire for network security even if there's monopoly/olipopoly is: with pay-for-service,
<moneromooo> people will use CPU/GPU for this. If this takes off, then we might get a large number of this going on.
<moneromooo> If we look at the actual monetary value for this, the user will pay N in electricity, and the service offerer
<moneromooo> will get N-n in actual revenue (since CPU/GPU will be less efficient that the overall network). So you can
<moneromooo> think that users will not do this since they pay more than they otherwise would, but it's also a convenience,
<moneromooo> something that can happen unnoticed by the user: mining in the background for services is convenient, so is
<moneromooo> worth a premium. Therefore, if n is small enough, CPUs/GPUs might still make up a good part of the network
<moneromooo> hash rate, keeping part of it decentralised enough that it helps keep the monopoly/olipopoly at bay.
<marmulak> Foxgod: multi-algo coins claim to have done that. They'll have one algo that favors ASIC's and another GPU's, another CPU's, and so someone with ASIC hardware will bring hashing power that won't compete with CPU miners
Foxgod03/01/2019
sounds good
maybe specific asic pools on one port
and specific gpu/cpu mining on others
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> I think a fork to a sha3-PoW could lead either lead to ASICS being built for aeon with an interesting future. And if there was no asic to be developed it would lead to a CN based coin which algo differs enough to now work with a regular xmr asisc
<moneromooo> FWIW zcash had some research about multi algorithm PoW and concluded it lowered security overall.
<marmulak> no one would make hardware specifically for aeon
thinkpol03/01/2019
indeed, and sha3 is not designed to be slow like CN

IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> It is: Alice offers something. Bob wants it. Bob will mine to Alice's address for a set number of shares at diff D. When done, Bob is deemed to have paid Alice.
<marmulak> ah
<moneromooo> Alice might have got a block, or not.
<marmulak> coopting end users to mine who otherwise wouldn't
<ksk> marmulak: utf-8
<moneromooo> If Alice has lots of users, the law of large numbers say she'll get ~ expected value.
<marmulak> but getting more people to mine just makes it harder for me to personally :(
<moneromooo> And that's good, it means the coin is more secure (ceteris paribus) :)
<marmulak> hmm
<ksk> yeah its not a business modell for a pool, but for a service with a large userbase, giving them a low-entree modell
<vp11> moneromooo, the point you just pasted is something that I think a lot about. But it seems like the counter to that is that verification time would be too high compared to easier algos. If "too high" is actually relevant to future hardware is unknown.
<marmulak> I seem to like the argument of, "asic's will do it best but not enough better to justify the cost of them"
<marmulak> so if we choose an algo that runs well on the cheapest most common hardware it gives end users the most opportunity to participate overall
<moneromooo> Yes, Alice's server would have to work at it, exactly like a pool server.
<ksk> marmulak: this totally depends on the future and on how someone is inclined to throw in money to get even more
<ksk> if at some point some dude thinks investing in aeon asics would be a good Idea, he might do it.
<marmulak> well there's always my suggestion to be the ones to make our own asic's and simply sell them to the public
Foxgod03/01/2019
i would buy one :smiley:
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> marmulak: crowdfunding?
<marmulak> yas
Foxgod03/01/2019
let people pay in monero to get an aeon asic, a promising Monero Lite ready to break out
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> also the thing with having a website that offers a service that you pay for by contributing mining power, it seems somewhat counterintuitive when a web-based service could simply provide said service in exchange for the asset itself
Foxgod03/01/2019
its good marketing
i mean, marketing is good
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> There's less barrier to entry. Anyone can mine. Compared to exchanging fiat to whatever coin and sending it.
<marmulak> like if I'm a web host and I want to charge someone 100 aeon per month for a service (let's say that's its value or what's necessary to cover the cost of running the service), some joe users in his browser is going to wait how long to provide me with the equivalent amount of hashing power?
<marmulak> maybe only a business like Google could take advantage of such a scheme
<moneromooo> Lots of time. But if you want 100 aeon per month, everyone will laugh at you and walk away :)
<moneromooo> I'm not sure it's viable in practice. Depends on the service.
<marmulak> true
<marmulak> well if I'm writing a blog and have thousands of readers
<marmulak> it might pay for the time it takes me to write it
thinkpol03/01/2019
sounds like BAT
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> seems right now only coinhive makes profit using this method, and according to krebs only a handful of accounts acount for >90% of the profits
<moneromooo> Without the ethical shenanigans :)
<marmulak> this is crypto, my friend
<marmulak> ethical shenanigans comes with the territory
<ksk> but I think if you have a really cheap product, like "reading this premium article" it could be a nice option
<marmulak> yeah
<moneromooo> It does require n to be small though. If n is too large, you end up with "Bob mines forever" or "Alice gets 1 USD after 10 years".
<marmulak> meh, mining
<marmulak> we're all going to be using stellar lumens eventually
<camthegeek> https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/5126#issuecomment-465983764 <- I'm left to assume here that ASIC's could already be in development (and soon production) for CN-R.

This is a proposal for the next Monero PoW algorithm. Please read original discussion before posting here.
Random integer math modification
Division and square root are replaced with a sequence of ...

<marmulak> How can an asic do random
<moneromooo> Same way a CPU can :)
<marmulak> ;o
<marmulak> I thought asic's were set in stone and couldn't change all the things like cpu's can
<moneromooo> Some ASICs can include some programmable components.
<moneromooo> They'll get slower here, typically.
<marmulak> are there any cpu's with sha3 instructions/support
<moneromooo> I know some recent Intels have some kind of SHA-2 support, relatedly.
<moneromooo> hyc might know about SHA-3.
<marmulak> well let's just do sha3 and see what happens
<marmulak> or modify it into an algo that solely aeon uses
Foxgod03/01/2019
that sounds like a safe option, specific aeon sha3 algo
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> as long as it runs good on my cpu's
<marmulak> I can't mine as it is
Foxgod03/01/2019
would keep us safe, until we become too big
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> my other box has no L3 cache and mines cryptonight terribly
<marmulak> I'm assuming SHA3 would not suffer for that
<moneromooo> I think cache is mostly irrelevant here.
<marmulak> it's currently mining myriad with yescript and generating enough hash to earn daily payouts, but xmy is much cheaper than aeon obv
<marmulak> so if I understand right sha3 has no hardware yet but maybe by the time asic's start coming back to aeon consumer hardware devices will support sha3 well enough to give our mining community a collective chance to resist centralization of mining through asic's
<marmulak> although if aeon ever really became popular and famous sooner or later someone will attempt to monopolize mining just as was done with bitcoin
<marmulak> it all sounds so futile
Foxgod03/01/2019
btw, if we sell our own asics, howabout going fpga instead?
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> but if aeon would have adopted the stance that "ASIC is okay" by then it would make for example a crowdfunding or other more open approaches of building a freely available ASIC more feasible
<marmulak> we could try to restrict mining to a closed community using an algo whose mining method is kept strictly secret. We'll initiate new members like Freemasons or the CPC
Foxgod03/01/2019
and allow algo updating on our own fpga only with a secure key thats individual to every unit and only handed to those who bought the fpga
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> I think the way xmr handles algo changes right now kind of encurages bad guys to produce and mine with asics in silent
<marmulak> fpga is much cheaper than asic?
<camthegeek> I agree with ksk's last comment.
Foxgod03/01/2019
maybe, but its updatable, and if you only allow own community to update on algo change with a unique key, you can have fpga,s and knock out copycats
thinkpol03/01/2019
fpga is something you can buy off the shelf and burn your code to
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> If you could safely plan with the knowledge that the AEON PoW is not going to change for the next time (because why should it, it works!), you could gather money for building an ASIC on a solid base
thinkpol03/01/2019
asic is manufactured with your code
"code"
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> you should forget about that unique key stuff, this would again be totally against everything CN stands for
<marmulak> if we can make an asic/fpga platform that is community oriented, open/available, and hopefully as affordable as possible, that just might be a net positive
Foxgod03/01/2019
but if we go sha3?
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> and this would make your coin a closed blockchain, like some big companies have.
Foxgod03/01/2019
we would still allow cpu gpu miners
but only community fpga
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> they're always allowed
<moneromooo> Not much difference between "only those few with the key can mine" and "only ASIC manufacturers can mine".
thinkpol03/01/2019
yup
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> Unless the latter decide to sell. But then you're relying on them to do it.
<marmulak> sine this is aeon, I know we're not in this to make ourselves a profit
<marmulak> we're doign this for humanity
Foxgod03/01/2019

IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> we need to tap connective mining power of the end users
<marmulak> the lifestyle is secure
<marmulak> collective, sorry
<marmulak> although it obviously has to be connective too
RockSteady (TRTL)03/01/2019
I feel like a misconception here is that we do things to gratify miners. The purpose of PoW is to secure the chain, and our GPUs patting us on the back doesn’t get that. Opinions involving feelings are not pertinent and are non-arguments.
Miners only have something to mine because someone will be there to buy it, if the network is dead or known to be not trustworthy then those people disappear
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> self-gratification is an important part of any crypto hobby
Foxgod03/01/2019
well we gratify te community, miners are part of it, they are not the center piece, but still a part
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> stellite seems to do a good job of getting its community to participate in mining
Foxgod03/01/2019

<camthegeek> I think I have said it before.. but if not: miners are like employees. they can be replaced.

IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> ouch
<marmulak> no matter what we do the end scenario is going to be the same
<marmulak> so does algo even really matter in the end
<camthegeek> finally getting on the right page. now ask, what advantages does SHA-3 serve over CN for AEON?
<marmulak> temporarily pleasing miners

Foxgod03/01/2019
yep, need to stay current
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> I think mining aeon right now with non-asic hardware cannot be productive by any means, so going for sha3 without any intermediate would not hurt profits for anyone
<marmulak> a bunch of nerds are going to look at our specs and be like, "oh damn, this uses sha3? I only heard of sha2"
Foxgod03/01/2019
only way to get traction in the sea of coins
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> it's like ipv6
thinkpol03/01/2019
going sha3 now means at least some time without the asics. they may eventually come but that's no different than now
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> but we do want to maximize that "some time"
<marmulak> which sha3 probably won't but hey
Foxgod03/01/2019
true, only thing against going now is, can the devs do it, without being pushed too much
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> thinkpol: as stated I beg to differ. If asics would arrive, a community or private firm could hop on the train, because AEON will not fork away to prevent these ASICs

how much man hours for the algo change, and how much is there in total already implementing bulletproofs and upstream code

ok :smiley:

<marmulak> ._.
<ksk> Foxgod: feel free to submit a PR ;)
<marmulak> still nobp
<camthegeek> Man hours depends on who is pulling the commits for the PoW variant changes.
<camthegeek> Man hours for SHA-3, I'm not familiar enough with the code yet to figure that one out.
<marmulak> we probably should commit to a standard, reliable algo
thinkpol03/01/2019
ah, i just meant that switching to sha3 will be no different than CNr in the short term - neither have asics yet
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<camthegeek> but one person switching AEON to SHA-3 one time should be less time consumed vs researching and developing variants each time.
<ksk> also, who are we to decide on the man hours of volunteers? its not like aeon has a paid coder working for us who does whatever "we" want..
<marmulak> we choose a standard, publicly commit to it, so everyone has security in planning, and urge our community to invest in mining
<marmulak> so that the community will compete with private interests on a level playing field
<camthegeek> @thinkpol yet is the keyword there.
<marmulak> sha3 the code is already written, right
<ksk> yes. also, having asics will become not a reason to fork in the future
<ksk> or, we want it to become this way. who knows..
<marmulak> if I could buy me own asic I would

i am not scared of asics either,

IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<ksk> Depending on the price I cold waste some money on a crowdfunding. but rather usb, and not datacenter-sized :D
<marmulak> also if I do shell out cash for an sha3 miner I can consider the future potential of mining other coins that could use that algo
<ksk> and while all of this lies in the future, we would have a solid ground for such plans by endorsing sha3 and an "Asics are okay" stance
Foxgod03/01/2019
would be great if loads of people would buy a small one, anormous decentralization
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> what if our community crowdfunding project manages to produce the very first sha3 hardware miner
<marmulak> how about an "asics are sorta okay but not quite yet" stance
<marmulak> Foxgod: I always thought that
Foxgod03/01/2019
slow transition
is better indeed
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> we should also make miners that can be installed into cars
Foxgod03/01/2019
btw, pr wise i would say rolling out sha3 around the same time as monero does cnr would be good
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> would it

IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> I think our own algo change will not be much affected by whatever monero is doing
<marmulak> at worst someone will say "aeon did it late" but screw them
<marmulak> if it's easier to copy monero then perhaps "cnr now, sha3 later" might be a viable plan
thinkpol03/01/2019
sha3 now!
Foxgod03/01/2019
my only opinion on this is as fast as the devs can do it
i want it now too, but i am clueless how fast it can be done
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<moneromooo> A day should be enough for a switch to SHA-3 (assuming the exact changes from Keccak are known).
<camthegeek> I think 3 weeks notice to exchanges, pools, etc is enough before the switch happens.
<moneromooo> Might need more than a day for testing etc.
<marmulak> does this mean I can't use xmrig anymore ._.
<marmulak> it's my favorite program
<moneromooo> You'll want to keep CNv0 for KDF purposes.
<marmulak> kids' development fun?
<marmulak> fund*
<moneromooo> Key derivation function. Something that protects your keys file if someone tries to crack your password.
<marmulak> I'm worried if we embrace asic's we'll turn into dero :'(
<marmulak> I'm reading about sha3 on wikipedia and apparently it is keccak, but you guys said it's different a little bit
<marmulak> oh I get it
<moneromooo> There's a difference to do with padding, and IIRC another to do with some constant somewhere.
<marmulak> keccak has many variants
<marmulak> hmm
<moneromooo> But not in the main loop. The main loop is identical I believe.

<marmulak> wow so apparently there's a kangarootwelve function
<marmulak> I'm sold
<marmulak> so if sha3 was designed to be hard to break, how does it stack up to something like cryptonite in that area
<marmulak> as it was not designed with mining in mind, only security
<marmulak> is cryptonight even proven secure by cryptologists?
<marmulak> hrm wikipedia seems to refer to cryponote like it's an algo itself
thinkpol03/01/2019
cryptonight designed to be slow, sha3 designed to be fast :shrug:
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> fast and secure
<marmulak> sha3 seems like a nice choice, apparently... tested, audited
<marmulak> although it would be funny if sha3 got broken before sha2 did
Foxgod03/01/2019
probably wont happen anytime soon, sha3 should be safe for quite some time
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> will sha3 cause my cpu to overheat
<marmulak> because cn sure as hell doesn't
<marmulak> damn you guys got me all excited about sha3 and now I am just sitting here waiting
thinkpol03/01/2019
i believe sha3 will cause your cpu to emit rainbows down the buses. or so i'm told.
IRC BridgeBOT03/01/2019
<marmulak> and unicorns!

<ksk> coming back to my question from before the meeting, as I think it might be over now.. :P
